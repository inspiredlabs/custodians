## The App

#### How it works

> Municipal workers take a photo where rubbish needs cleaning up, this is then sent to local cleaners to clear.

#### Where to download

At the moment there are two places to get `CESP, Earth Solution Platform`:

- [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cesp/id6446498068)
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ettsolutions.mustv2.EarthSolutionPlatform)

#### Supporting content

What is the most worthwhile content to support this app? Here's a quick direction we could take:

- Expand how Municipalities use the app to help protect the environment already:
  - track abandoned waste
  - track detritus floating in water
  - track other pollution, etc.
- How can more people from the `Target Audience` use the app? <!-- could it help unemployed people get work? -->
- How will website content stategically promote the app:
  - backlinks and networking.
  - on social media.
  - SEO keywords.
- People have a sense of responsibility towards the environment which aligns with The Custodians goal â€“ but, how do we know the app is working?

<!--
> Be the change you want to see in the world
-->

### Target Audience

#### App &amp; Website Differences

While the app is aimed at the Municipal level, the website needs to appeal to different groups of people too.

Knowing how to segment different `Target Audience` groups helps prioritise the strategic aims of the project. This includes delivering features, content creation &amp; promotion.

#### Audience Segmentation

Currently, the `Target Audience` has been loosly described as _People with a sense of responsibility towards the environment_.

For best results we should target specific goals at specific groups of the audience. This will have the following oucomes:

- save us from pitfalls of appealing to _everybody_.
- help us focus on what actions we want our audience to take.
- campaign coherently offline, across Social Media &amp; support these efforts with streaming content.
- help us produce evergreen content or approach audiences with specific terminology, local-knowledge or multilingual content as appropriate.

#### Communication Style

With different audiences it can be useful to establish strategic channels of communication.

People working in traditional organisations such as the Maritime sector might prefer formal communication, while people from another background may require a different level of familiarity. <!-- Such as gender pronouns. -->

Different channels can be effective at making a distinction.

The [BioDesign Foundation Brochure](https://biodesignfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Web-Brochure-BioDesign-Foundation-EN.pdf) makes a good impression. If the website continues in this style, it could work well.

## Wordpress Page

This Wordpress Page (https://thecustodians.org/en/) appears to be down, although search engines are showing these results:

- Italiano SERP: `biodesignfoundation: Nasce l'organizzazione no profit che si occupa di trovare soluzioni concrete ai problemi ecologici del pianeta`
- SERP: `We Custodians are the movement of the BioDesign Foundation. We are the think tank for improving our way of doing business and our lifestyle - for the protection of nature and for a more beautiful and healthier life.`

## Content Ideas

### Sections

I use a process called `Information Architecture`, to organise content in a way that works holistically to include: websites, apps &amp; offline media. This works by tailoring content to across `Target Audience` segments &amp; uses specific goals.

Here is a sketch of the site content:

- About
- Projects:
  - The App
  - Partnership projects&hellip;
- Partnerships:
  - Municipalities
  - Maritime Military
  - Coast Guard
  - Tech partners, such as [River Cleaning System](https://designedconscious.com/plastics-in-the-ocean/sustainability-news-stories/12-river-plastic-cleanup-projects/#h-river-cleaning-system-italy), and other affiliates.
- Ways to get involved:
  - Invest, rather than `Donate`
  - Volunteer
- Ambassadors:
  - sports people
  - who else?
- Social media
- Contact:
  - email BioDesign Foundation
  - We will need a privacy policy if people can `Subscribe` to our newsletter
- Media (streaming video &amp; audio services)

### Categories

Blog categories may include: `food`, `plastics`, `project work`, including: `river & ocean cleaning`, `technology`, `partner stories`.

### Media

Streaming media requires considerable resources,Â so it can be valuable to use existing services. By understanding our audience we should be able to thoughtfully tailor the user experience while saving energy.

### Functionality

While not strictly "Content", when people `Subscribe`, this means we are handling data (which have both privacy &amp; test implications).

It's also important to consider what other functionality we can accomadate.

## Schedule

The project has been in the initial phases for over 18 months, but it's time to lauch the website.

### Social Media

Starting two weeks ago, there is someone to concentrate on network building via Social Media.

They will:
- promote The Custodians.
- find volunteers to clean.
- promote uptake of the App.

### Current Priorities

Currently The Custodians are travelling through Italy, into Slovakia for promotional/cleaning events until August.

Virginia is Roberto's focal point for strategic thinking.

Scott is freely available from: `July 2023` to design &amp; develop the project.

## Technologies

ðŸš€ **[CUSTODIANS.SITE](https://custodians.site/) staging-environment is live**

<!-- It has been inspired by: https://biodesignfoundation.org/en/custodians-3/ -->

A staging site is ideal to structure a project before deciding to publicly launch across Social Media or your own domain.

Behind the scenes [CUSTODIANS.SITE](https://custodians.site/) has been prepared with next-generation technologies to help produce a better user experience (UX), &amp; avoid security issues (like when using: _Wordpress_<!-- or obsolete applications such as `jQuery` -->).

Currently the application includes:

- Sveltekit (for animation, interaction &amp; routing)
- Github (for collaboration)

Other technologies will be decided on a case-by-case basis, usually during the [Definition Phase](#the-double-diamond-process).

Technology questions might include:

- which devices are we visiting the site?
- can we automate parts of our workflow with AI?
- do we need to integrate with Youtube or other services?
- if we use Github, do we even need a CMS â€“ if so, which one?
- what [Functionality](#functionality) do users need â€“Â eg: `search` from the very beginning, etc.?

<!--
Depending on the requirements of the project:

- Hygraph CMS
- Notion CMS, OpenAI &amp; Supabase
- digital assistant/chatbot
-->

## The Process

### Assets

#### Content

Transalting ideas into a working application can be fun! However, it's also valuable to concentrate on how content should be used.

- Content has a strategic integrity of it's own (for example it can be _reusable_, like BioDesign Foundation's content).
- Assets, like as photos, illustrations &amp; written material can be interoperable across-media (EG: it's possible to produce PDFs, apps &amp; website that share consistent data).
- Multilingual content can often be rewritten for local audiences using _transcreation_. This process helps ideas resonate better &amp; helps audiences take more specific actions.

#### Graphic Design &amp; Animation

Here's some ideas about the "look-and-feel" of the project:

Graphic Design is most useful:
- produced as inspirational mood-boards.
- produced as loose composition, layout &amp; typography.
- `Figma` can be helpful, but to translate concepts properly, it's important to capture priority information first. I call this part of a project the [Discovery Phase](#discovery-phase). Distinct phases help produce predictable shared results &amp; avoid duplicating effort.
- The **Colani** site is a useful reference for style &amp; animation: https://www.colani.com/

#### The Double Diamond Process

> The **Double Diamond** is a strategy to bind everything together and also visualise where we are in whole the process&hellip;

This holistic approach helps us iterate where appropriate, and build on known outcomes and information.
