### Target Audience

This helps us prioritise web design features and the strategic aims of the project.

Currently, the `Target Audience` has been loosly described as _People with a sense of responsibility towards the environment_. For best results, it is a good idea to describe audiences in detail and target them with specific goals you have in mind for each of them.

This will have two broad oucomes:
- save us from the pitfalls associated with trying to appeal to everybody.
- helps focus on what actions we want our audience members to take.

## Content

### The App

#### How it works

> Municipal workers take a photo where rubbish needs cleaning up, this is then sent to local cleaners to clear.

#### Where to download CESP

At the moment there are two places to get `CESP, Earth Solution Platform`:

- [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cesp/id6446498068)
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ettsolutions.mustv2.EarthSolutionPlatform)

#### What content should support the app?

What is the most worthwhile content that could support the app:

- Expand on how Municipalities are using the app to help protect the environment already:
  - track abandoned waste
  - track rubbish found in water
  - track other pollution, etc.
- How can more people from the `Target Audience` use the app? <!-- could it help unemployed people get work? -->
- How can the website content help promote the app over social media?
- People have a sense of responsibility towards the environment. That aligns with the app's goal too â€“ but, how do we know it's working?

<!--
> Be the change you want to see in the world
-->

### Sections

By using a process called `Information Architecture`, we can tailor content to our `Target Audience` using specific goals. Here is a sketch of what content could be on the site:

- Projects:
  - The App
  - Partnership projects&hellip;
- About
- Partnerships:
  - Municipalities
  - Maritime Military
  - Coast Guard
  - Tech partners, such as [River Cleaning System](https://designedconscious.com/plastics-in-the-ocean/sustainability-news-stories/12-river-plastic-cleanup-projects/#h-river-cleaning-system-italy), and other affiliates.
- Invest, rather than `Donate`.
- Ambassadors: sports people.
- Contact:
  - Social media
  - email form
  - can people `Subscribe` to a newsletter? If so we'll need a privacy policy in place from the very begining.
- Streaming: podcast && video

### Categories

Blog categories may include: `food`, `plastics`, `project work`, including: `river & ocean cleaning`, `technology`.

### Media

Streaming media requires considerable resources,Â so it's valuable to stream video or host a Podcast thoughtfully. We should use services that can be tailored to project requirements and audience needs.

## Technologies

ðŸš€ **[CUSTODIANS.SITE](https://custodians.site/) is ready as a staging-environment**

<!-- It has been inspired by: https://biodesignfoundation.org/en/custodians-3/ -->

A staging site is ideal to design &amp; develop the structure of your project before deciding to publicly release it on a domain name you own.

Behind the scenes [CUSTODIANS.SITE](https://custodians.site/) has been prepared with next-generation technologies. This helps you avoid security issues from _Wordpress_ <!-- or obsolete applications such as `jQuery` -->from the very begining.

These application technologies include:

- Sveltekit
- Vercel
- Github

Integrations will be decided on a case-by-case basis. This happens during the _Discovery &amp; Definition Phases_. Technology questions might include: what CMS? Or, how do we automate parts of the workflow using AI?

<!--
Depending on the requirements of the project:

- Hygraph CMS
- Notion CMS, OpenAI &amp; Supabase
-->

## The Current Site

**The Custodians** site is currently down: https://thecustodians.org/en/, although the search engine has these results:

- Italiano SERP: `biodesignfoundation: Nasce l'organizzazione no profit che si occupa di trovare soluzioni concrete ai problemi ecologici del pianeta`
- SERP: `We Custodians are the movement of the BioDesign Foundation. We are the think tank for improving our way of doing business and our lifestyle - for the protection of nature and for a more beautiful and healthier life.`

## The Double Diamond Process

> The **Double Diamond** is a strategy to bind everything together and also visualise where we are in whole the process&hellip;

This holistic approach helps us iterate where appropriate, and build on known outcomes and information.

### Human Computer Interaction for AI

Scott Phillips is developing an AI **Personal Shopping Assistant**, to discuss environmental ethics for [Balaveda](https://balaveda.vercel.app/).

This **Companion AI** is designed to extend [InstantWebapp](https://www.instantwebapp.com), to help people interact with <!-- databases, websites &amp; other large corpus of information - -> complex data using a simplified interface which can add meaning to information.

Natural language support is possible using OpenAI API &amp; the product will support other LLM technologies.
